# Leveraging a Self-Sufficient Energy Efficient Architecture in an IoT/Fog Smart Building.

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

The following self sufficient energy efficient architecture was scaled to accommodate 28 IoT/Fog edge devices, 20 sensors, 16 actuators, 2 area gateways, 1 proxy server and 1 central cloud server. Hence, the same edge/cloud design pattern was scaled to connect 4 PIR camera sensors deployed at the fog cloud layer to 4 sensors each. Two sensors deployed at the edge were each connected to an area gateway where one area gateway established a connection to a proxy server and central cloud server.

The simulation was conducted in iFogSim with the Java programming language and runtime environment (JDK 11)
